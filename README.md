## Description

Hello! My name is Ian Ferguson, and I am currently a student in the Coding Bootcamp at Arizona State University. We have been tasked with making a [Portfolio](https://temptag.github.io/Portfolio/) page to showcase our projects throughout the Bootcamp, and this is that web application! This Portfolio will evolve over time, starting out with basic html and css, and adding technologies as I learn and grow. Thank you for reading!
