            <h3>Welcome!</h3>
            <p>
              I am Ian Ferguson, from the always-gorgeous desert of Arizona.
              With over 20 years of experience in the Automotive and Medical
              industries. I have journeyed through every corner of the business
              world, from entry-level Warehouse positions to the heights of
              Executive leadership, and I am now the proud owner of a few
              businesses of my own. My expertise spans sales, management,
              marketing, and operations—essentially, if it has moving parts, I
              have probably managed it, marketed it, and sold it.
              <br />
              <br />
              My secret to success? Making it ridiculously easy for our
              customers to do business with us, and for us to do business with
              them. Seriously, I have made it my mission.
              <br />
              <br />
              As the world shifts further into online purchasing, I have decided
              to hit the books again—web development books, that is. I am diving
              into the digital world to make our customer experience smoother
              than a car with a fresh ceramic coating. Through my studies, I aim
              to bridge the gap between the sales processes of modern business
              and developers, ensuring that technology works seamlessly for
              everyone… all in the continuation of my mission. This portfolio is
              a showcase of projects completed during my studies. So, buckle up
              and enjoy the ride!
